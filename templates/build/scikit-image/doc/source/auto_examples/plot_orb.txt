==========================================
ORB feature detector and binary descriptor
==========================================

This example demonstrates the ORB feature detection and binary description
algorithm. It uses an oriented FAST detection method and the rotated BRIEF
descriptors.

Unlike BRIEF, ORB is comparatively scale- and rotation-invariant while still
employing the very efficient Hamming distance metric for matching. As such, it
is preferred for real-time applications.

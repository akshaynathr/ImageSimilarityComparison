=======================
BRIEF binary descriptor
=======================

This example demonstrates the BRIEF binary description algorithm.

The descriptor consists of relatively few bits and can be computed using
a set of intensity difference tests. The short binary descriptor results
in low memory footprint and very efficient matching based on the Hamming
distance metric.

BRIEF does not provide rotation-invariance. Scale-invariance can be achieved by
detecting and extracting features at different scales.

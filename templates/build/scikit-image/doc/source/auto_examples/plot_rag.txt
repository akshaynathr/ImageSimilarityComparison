=======================
Region Adjacency Graphs
=======================

This example demonstrates the use of the `merge_nodes` function of a Region
Adjacency Graph (RAG). The `RAG` class represents a undirected weighted graph
which inherits from `networkx.graph` class. When a new node is formed by
merging two nodes, the edge weight of all the edges incident on the resulting
node can be updated by a user defined function `weight_func`.

The default behaviour is to use the smaller edge weight in case of a conflict.
The example below also shows how to use a custom function to select the larger
weight instead.
